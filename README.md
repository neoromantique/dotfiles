### caveat: these are mostly for own reference while setting up devices, most of these are llm slop

Dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io/). Supports CachyOS (desktop) and Bluefin (laptop) with device-specific configs for Hyprland, Waybar, and related tools. Templates handle monitor setup, touchpad/gestures, battery modules, and idle behavior automatically based on hostname detection.
